### 1. Install utilities


All components use [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/nextjs), so ensure it's installed in your project.
Many components also use the `cn` utility function—install it with the following command:

<Tabs items={["bun", "npx", "pnpm"]}>
 
```bash tab="bun"
bunx --bun shadcn@latest add https://kokonutui.com/r/utils.json 
```
 
```bash tab="npx"
npx shadcn@latest add https://kokonutui.com/r/utils.json
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://kokonutui.com/r/utils.json
```

</Tabs>

### 2. That's it 🎉

We use [lucide-icons](https://lucide.dev/guide/installation) for most components that include icons, along with some [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components. These dependencies will be automatically installed when using the CLI.

For exemple to add `card-05` to your project, it will be easy as:

<Tabs items={["bun", "npx", "pnpm"]}>
 
```bash tab="bun"
bunx --bun shadcn@latest add https://kokonutui.com/r/particle-button
```
 
```bash tab="npx"
npx shadcn@latest add https://kokonutui.com/r/particle-button
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://kokonutui.com/r/particle-button
```

</Tabs>

_While we provide a convenient 'copy' button for the code, we strongly recommend using the CLI for installing components, as it ensures all necessary files are included._

Add to your page and it works!

```jsx
import ParticleButton from "@/components/kokonutui/particle-button";

export default function Page() {
    return <ParticleButton />;
}
```

import { Tab, Tabs } from "fumadocs-ui/components/tabs"

### 3. Optionnal dependencies

Some components require additional libraries, listed at the bottom of each components. Make sure to install them to ensure the component works properly.

### 4. Monorepo

For monorepo `shadcn/ui` CLI contain the options `-c` to the path to your workspace for exemple:

<Tabs items={["bun", "npx", "pnpm"]}>
 
```bash tab="bun"
bunx --bun shadcn@latest add https://kokonutui.com/r/card-05.json -c ./apps/www
```
 
```bash tab="npx"
npx shadcn@latest add https://kokonutui.com/r/card-05.json -c ./apps/www
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://kokonutui.com/r/card-05.json -c ./apps/www
```

</Tabs>
