## Getting Started

KokonutUI components are meant to be use with Next.js projects that use TailwindCSS and shadcn. However they are also compatible with any React Project.

-   **Copy and Paste**: Select and copy the component code you want to use.

-   **Check Requirements**: Some components need additional libraries (e.g., Framer Motion). Required libraries are listed at the top-right corner of each component.
-   **Customize as Needed**: Modify styles and animations to match your project’s look and feel or simply use the default one.
